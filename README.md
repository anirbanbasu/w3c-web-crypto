# W3C Web Crypto - repository
This repository contains draft documents (typically, in the W3C Respec format) and reference implementations of cryptographic algorithms that have been proposed or will be proposed for standardisation through the W3C Web Crypto community. The mere presence of some information in this repository does not imply that it has been endorsed by any standardisation body. 

## KCipher-2
KCipher-2 is a fast and lightweight stream cipher algorithm developed by KDDI R&D Laboratories in Japan. It has been standardised by the ISO/IEC SC27. [See ISO/IEC 18033 part 4.] (http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=54532) It is also recommended by the Japanese Government. [See list of eGovernment Recommended Ciphers.](http://www.cryptrec.go.jp/english/method.html) The draft Respec document for this stream cipher can be found [here] (http://anirbanbasu.github.io/w3c-web-crypto/respec/kcipher.html).
